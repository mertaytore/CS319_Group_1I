# Project Description
In this project, we will be remaking the Atari game of Battle City and we will be creating a desktop version of it. It is a two-player castle defending game that the players aim to destroy other player's castle. There will be three maps with varying difficulty levels, and a map creator mode. Users will be able to create their own maps, load them and play against each other. In the game, tanks will have upgrades which change their bullet powers and their health (defence level). Players will use tanks' bullets to destroy the blocks of different types of obstacles to reach their opponents' castle.
